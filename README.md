Crowdfunding Platform for Education
Vision
The Crowdfunding Platform for Education aims to make education more accessible by providing a decentralized and transparent way for students to raise funds for their education fees. By leveraging blockchain technology,
the platform ensures trust, security, and traceability in campaigns. Students can create campaigns, donors can contribute, and everyone can track the progress transparently without the need for intermediaries.

Features
Campaign Creation: Students can create fundraising campaigns by setting their financial goals. Each campaign is tied to a unique creator and has a tracking mechanism for the collected balance.

Donation System: Donors can contribute to active campaigns with the desired amount, helping students reach their financial goals.

Fund Withdrawal: Once the campaign reaches its financial goal, the student can withdraw the funds, ensuring that contributions are only accessible upon reaching the target.

Messaging System: Donors and supporters can send messages to the campaign creators. This helps build a community around the campaign and keeps communication transparent.

Campaign Status: Each campaign has an active status and can be closed automatically when the goal is met and funds are withdrawn.

The platform is built using the Aptos blockchain smart contract system. The contract manages campaign creation, donations, fund transfers, and messaging functionality.
